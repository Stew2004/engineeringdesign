   <center><h1>ABOUT ME</h1></center>
 <center><div class="narrative">
 <p>This is my 13th year teaching science at Riley County High School. I have improved a lot as a teacher over the years, but there are some aspects of my job that I am still trying to get better at. Right now I am working on learning how to code so that I can teach my students the basics of coding. I believe that this is a skill that will serve them well no matter where they go or what they choose to do in their future.<br><br>
 I am very passionate about teaching, but I also love reading, doing art, dancing, attending concerts, tinkering around on piano and guiatar, playing sports and watching my children participate in their athletic and musical activities. </p></center>
